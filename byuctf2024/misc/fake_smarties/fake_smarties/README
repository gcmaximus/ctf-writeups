Last year in school, I took a text-processing and analysis class at BYU. In this class, we learned about creating Machine Learning models for analyzing texts. My final project for this class was some Python code that could guess a user's political affiliation based on webscraped Reddit comments. Unfortunately, I got absolutely clowned on during my presentation because I made a few fatal mistakes with my code. Can you exploit my issues to get the flag?
