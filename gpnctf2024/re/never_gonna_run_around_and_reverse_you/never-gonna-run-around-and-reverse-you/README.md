# Never gonna run around and reverse you
I thought of this really cool collision free hash function and hashed the flag with it. Theoretically you shouldn't be able to reverse it...

# Flag
```
GPNCTF{W41t,_h0w_d1d_y0u_s0lv3_th1s?_I_th0ught_1t_w45_4_g00d_h45h}
```

# Solution
Automated bruteforcing of the flag. See `solve.py`
