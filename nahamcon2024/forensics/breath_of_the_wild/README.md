# Breath of the Wild
I got a sweet desktop background for my favorite video game, but now I want more! Problem is, I forget where I downloaded it from... can you help me remember where I got this old one?

Here's a backup of all my wallpapers. For security, I set the drive password to be videogames.

Unzip and add the `.vhdx` extension to the extracted file.

Open "Computer Management" in Windows and attach the VHD.

Unlock the password-protected drive using the password `videogames`. There are many photos in the drive.
